## Fonts that make this theme shine

I recommend using fonts that have good support for ligatures, such as:

- [Zed Mono (Recommended, used in screenshots above)](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed-fonts) or any config of [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) 
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [Monaspace Neon](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace)
